# Waveform Editor

The Waveform Editor is a Python tool for creating and managing 1D time-dependent data called waveforms. It utilizes a human-readable, text-based file format where waveforms are described using descriptive tendencies, such as sine waves or linear ramps. The Waveform Editor includes a GUI for interactive creation, editing, and organization of waveforms.

## Install

To install the waveform editor, run the following:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/iterorganization/Waveform-Editor.git
cd Waveform-Editor
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source ./venv/bin/activate
pip install .
```

## Usage

The GUI can be launched using:
```bash
panel serve waveform_editor/gui/main.py --show
```

Or the CLI can be launched using:

```
